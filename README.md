# Smoker Classification Prediction Models

### Machine Learning Course


<br/>

##### Description: 
# 
This project focuses on implementing prediction models to classify patients as smokers or non-smokers based on their basic biological data. 
The main objective is to train, test, and compare the performance of various learning systems in this classification task.

#### Models Utilized:

- Decision Trees
- Neural Networks
- K-Means

These models are employed to determine the smoking status of patients, enabling the evaluation of their effectiveness in classification tasks.
